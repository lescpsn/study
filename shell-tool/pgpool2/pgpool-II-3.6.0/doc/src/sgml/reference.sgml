   <title>PCP commands</title>

   <partintro>
     <para>
       This part contains reference information for PCP commands.
       PCP commands are UNIX commands which manipulate pgpool-II via the network.
       Please note that the parameter format for all PCP commands has been changed since pgpool-II 3.5.
     </para>

     <sect1 id="pcp-connection-authentication">
       <title>PCP connection authentication</title>
       <para>
	 PCP user names and passwords must be declared in
	 <filename>pcp.conf</filename> in <filename>$prefix/etc</filename>
	 directory. <option>-F</option> option can be used when starting
	 pgpool-II if <filename>pcp.conf</filename> is placed somewhere
	 else.
       </para>
     </sect1>

     <sect1 id="pcp-password-file">
       <title>PCP password file</title>
       <para>
	 The file <filename>.pcppass</filename> in a user's home
	 directory or the file referenced by environment variable
	 PCPPASSFILE can contain passwords to be used if no password has
	 been specified for the pcp connection.
       </para>
       <para>
	 This file should contain lines of the following format:

	 <programlisting>
	   hostname:port:username:password
	 </programlisting>
       </para>

       <para>
	 (You can add a reminder comment to the file by copying the line
	 above and preceding it with #.)  Each of the first three fields
	 can be a literal value, or *, which matches anything. The password
	 field from the first line that matches the current connection
	 parameters will be used. (Therefore, put more-specific entries
	 first when you are using wildcards.) If an entry needs to contain
	 : or \, escape this character with \. A host name of localhost
	 matches both TCP (host name localhost) and Unix domain socket
	 connections coming from the local machine.
       </para>

       <para>
	 The permissions on .pcppass must disallow any access to world or
	 group; achieve this by the command chmod 0600 ~/.pcppass. If the
	 permissions are less strict than this, the file will be
	 ignored.
